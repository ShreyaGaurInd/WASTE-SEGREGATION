Our project is a Smart Waste Segregation and Monitoring System that uses sensors and servo motors to classify wet and dry waste automatically. Citizens scan a QR code to use the bin and earn eco-points for correct disposal. Data is synced to a Blynk IoT dashboard, enabling ULBs to monitor waste levels, compliance, and improve city cleanliness.
